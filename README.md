# What is time?
Understanding time in three files

This is the modern way of understanding the concept of TIME.

Let's imagine past, present and future as three files:
- past.txt
- present.txt
- future.txt.

The common thing about files that you either read them or write(change) them.

So the idea is that every file have different permissions.

### PAST - read only
- canâ€™t change the past, but you have memory of it

### PRESENT - read & write
- you have perception of it and can change stuff

### FUTURE - no permissions
- future is unknown and changes through present
